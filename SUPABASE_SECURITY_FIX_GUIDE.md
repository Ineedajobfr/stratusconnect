# 🔒 SUPABASE SECURITY FIX GUIDE

## Complete Security & Configuration Resolution

**Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Status**: Ready to Deploy

---

## 🎯 ISSUES ADDRESSED

### ✅ Automated Fixes (SQL Migration)
1. **RLS Not Enabled** - 6 tables fixed
2. **Security Definer View** - api.users view fixed
3. **Extensions in Public Schema** - Moved to extensions schema
4. **Missing RLS Policies** - Complete policies created
5. **Performance Indexes** - Added for all RLS policies

### ⚠️ Manual Configuration Required (Supabase Dashboard)
1. **Email OTP Expiry** - Must be set to < 1 hour
2. **HaveIBeenPwned Integration** - Enable password checking

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT

### Step 1: Run the SQL Migration

**In Supabase Dashboard:**

1. Go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click **New Query**
3. Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250110000001_fix_security_issues.sql`
4. Paste into the editor
5. Click **Run**
6. Wait for completion (should take ~10-30 seconds)
7. Check for success messages in output

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ All public tables have RLS enabled!
🎉 SECURITY MIGRATION COMPLETED!
```

---

### Step 2: Manual Configuration Changes

#### 2.1 Fix Email OTP Expiry

**Navigate to:**
- Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication** → **Providers** → **Email**

**Current Issue:**
- OTP expiry is set to more than 1 hour

**Fix:**
1. Scroll to **Email OTP Settings**
2. Find **OTP Expiry** field
3. Change value to: `3600` (1 hour in seconds)
   - Or use: `1800` (30 minutes - recommended)
4. Click **Save**

**Why this matters:**
- Shorter OTP expiry = More secure
- Reduces window for OTP theft/interception
- Industry best practice is 15-60 minutes

---

#### 2.2 Enable HaveIBeenPwned Password Checking

**Navigate to:**
- Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication** → **Policies**

**Current Issue:**
- Compromised password checking is disabled

**Fix:**
1. Scroll to **Password Protection**
2. Find **Check against HaveIBeenPwned** toggle
3. **Enable** the toggle
4. Click **Save**

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents users from using compromised passwords
- Protects against credential stuffing attacks
- Free service, no API key required
- Checks against 600+ million breached passwords

---

### Step 3: Verify All Fixes

#### 3.1 Check RLS Status

**In Supabase Dashboard:**
- Go to **Database** → **Tables**
- Check each table for RLS badge:
  - ✅ `quotes` - Should show RLS enabled
  - ✅ `signals` - Should show RLS enabled
  - ✅ `hourly_rate_baseline` - Should show RLS enabled
  - ✅ `airports` - Should show RLS enabled
  - ✅ `operators` - Should show RLS enabled
  - ✅ `spatial_ref_sys` - Should show RLS enabled

#### 3.2 Check Extensions Schema

**Run this query in SQL Editor:**
```sql
SELECT
  extname AS extension_name,
  nspname AS schema_name
FROM pg_extension e
JOIN pg_namespace n ON e.extnamespace = n.oid
WHERE extname IN ('postgis', 'citext');
```

**Expected Output:**
```
extension_name | schema_name
---------------+-------------
postgis        | extensions
citext         | extensions
```

#### 3.3 Check API Users View

**Run this query in SQL Editor:**
```sql
SELECT
  n.nspname AS schema,
  c.relname AS view_name,
  CASE 
    WHEN c.relrowsecurity THEN 'SECURITY INVOKER'
    ELSE 'SECURITY DEFINER'
  END AS security_mode
FROM pg_class c
JOIN pg_namespace n ON c.relnamespace = n.oid
WHERE n.nspname = 'api'
AND c.relname = 'users';
```

**Expected Output:**
```
schema | view_name | security_mode
-------+-----------+------------------
api    | users     | SECURITY INVOKER
```

## 🔍 WHAT THE MIGRATION DOES

### 1. RLS Enablement (6 Tables)

**Tables Secured:**
```sql
-- All these tables now have RLS enabled:
public.quotes
public.signals
public.hourly_rate_baseline
public.airports
public.operators
public.spatial_ref_sys
```

### 2. RLS Policies Created

#### Quotes Table Policies:
- ✅ Brokers can view quotes for their RFQs
- ✅ Operators can view quotes they submitted
- ✅ Operators can create quotes
- ✅ Operators can update their own pending quotes
- ✅ Admins can view/manage all quotes

#### Signals Table Policies:
- ✅ Users can view their own signals
- ✅ Users can create their own signals
- ✅ Users can update their own signals
- ✅ Admins can view/manage all signals

#### Hourly Rate Baseline Policies:
- ✅ Everyone can view (public data)
- ✅ Only admins can modify

#### Airports Table Policies:
- ✅ Everyone can view (public directory)
- ✅ Only admins can modify

#### Operators Table Policies:
- ✅ Everyone can view (public directory)
- ✅ Operators can create/update their own profile
- ✅ Admins can manage all operators

#### Spatial Ref Sys Policies:
- ✅ Everyone can view (PostGIS system table)

### 3. Extensions Moved

**Before:**
```
public.postgis
public.citext
```

**After:**
```
extensions.postgis
extensions.citext
```

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner public schema
- Better organization
- Supabase best practices
- No security warnings

### 4. API Users View Fixed

**Before:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW api.users WITH (security_definer = true) AS ...
-- ⚠️ SECURITY DEFINER = runs with view creator's permissions
```

**After:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW api.users WITH (security_invoker = true) AS ...
-- ✅ SECURITY INVOKER = runs with caller's permissions
```

**Why this is safer:**
- Users can only see their own data
- No privilege escalation
- Follows principle of least privilege

### 5. Performance Indexes

**Added indexes for RLS policy performance:**
```sql
-- Quotes table
idx_quotes_rfq_id
idx_quotes_operator_id
idx_quotes_status

-- Signals table
idx_signals_user_id

-- Operators table
idx_operators_user_id

-- Profiles table
idx_profiles_role
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster RLS policy checks
- Improved query performance
- Reduced database load

## 🧪 TESTING THE FIXES

### Test 1: Verify RLS on Quotes

**As Broker (broker_id = 'xxx'):**
```sql
-- Should only see quotes for YOUR RFQs
SELECT * FROM quotes;
```

**As Operator (operator_id = 'yyy'):**
```sql
-- Should only see quotes YOU submitted
SELECT * FROM quotes;
```

**As Admin:**
```sql
-- Should see ALL quotes
SELECT * FROM quotes;
```

### Test 2: Verify RLS on Signals

**As Regular User:**
```sql
-- Should only see YOUR signals
SELECT * FROM signals;
```

### Test 3: Verify Public Tables

**As Any User:**
```sql
-- Should be able to view (public data)
SELECT * FROM airports LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM hourly_rate_baseline LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM operators LIMIT 10;
```

### Test 4: Verify API Users View

**Run as authenticated user:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM api.users;
-- Should only return YOUR user data
```

## 📊 SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS

### Before Migration:
- ❌ 6 tables with no RLS
- ❌ Public data accessible to anyone
- ❌ Extensions in public schema
- ❌ SECURITY DEFINER view (privilege escalation risk)
- ⚠️ OTP expiry > 1 hour
- ⚠️ No compromised password checking

### After Migration + Manual Config:
- ✅ All tables have RLS enabled
- ✅ Granular access control per role
- ✅ Extensions in dedicated schema
- ✅ SECURITY INVOKER view (safe)
- ✅ OTP expiry < 1 hour
- ✅ HaveIBeenPwned password checking

---

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Migration fails on PostGIS extension

**Error:**
```
ERROR: extension "postgis" has dependent objects
```

**Solution:**
The migration includes CASCADE to handle this, but if it still fails:

1. Manually drop PostGIS:
   ```sql
   DROP EXTENSION postgis CASCADE;
   ```

2. Recreate in extensions schema:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION postgis WITH SCHEMA extensions;
   ```

3. Re-run dependent table migrations if needed

### Issue: RLS policies conflict with existing policies

**Error:**
```
ERROR: policy "policy_name" already exists
```

**Solution:**
The migration includes `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` statements. If issues persist:

1. List existing policies:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'quotes';
   ```

2. Drop manually:
   ```sql
   DROP POLICY "old_policy_name" ON public.quotes;
   ```

3. Re-run migration

### Issue: Cannot access data after enabling RLS

**Symptom:**
Queries return 0 rows after migration

**Solution:**
Ensure user has correct role in profiles table:

```sql
-- Check your role
SELECT role FROM public.profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();

-- If null, set it:
UPDATE public.profiles SET role = 'broker' WHERE id = auth.uid();
-- Replace 'broker' with: operator, pilot, crew, or admin
```
