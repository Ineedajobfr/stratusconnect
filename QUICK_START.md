# 🚀 QUICK START - Get Your Platform Running in 10 Minutes

## ✅ Migration Errors Fixed

Both PostgreSQL errors have been resolved:
- ✅ **Error 42703** (column doesn't exist) - Fixed
- ✅ **Error 42710** (policy already exists) - Fixed

The migration is now **idempotent** (safe to run multiple times).

---

## 🎯 3 Simple Steps to Launch

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration (5 minutes)

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy entire content of **`apply-all-migrations.sql`**
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"**
6. Wait ~30 seconds
7. Check result: Should see **"✅ All 9 tables created successfully"**

**Note**: You may see warnings like "table already exists" or "column already exists" - these are **SAFE TO IGNORE**. The script uses `IF NOT EXISTS` checks and `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` to handle existing objects.

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket (2 minutes)

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Storage**
2. Click **"Create a new bucket"**

## 🚨 Common Issues

### "Some warnings during migration"
**Normal!** Warnings like "table already exists" are expected if you've run previous migrations. Safe to ignore.

### "TensorFlow.js still showing errors in terminal"
**Expected!** Those are old errors from before we installed it. The dev server has been restarted - it's working now.

### "Storage bucket already exists"
**Great!** Skip Step 2 if the bucket is already created. Just verify the settings match.
