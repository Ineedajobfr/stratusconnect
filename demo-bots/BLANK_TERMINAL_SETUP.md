# Blank Terminal Setup - Demo Bots Enhancement

**FCA Compliant Aviation Platform - Complete Proof of Life from Scratch**

## 🎯 Overview

The demo bots have been enhanced to **start with completely blank terminals** to demonstrate that the entire StratusConnect aviation platform works from a fresh state. This provides undeniable proof that the system works from scratch, not just with pre-existing data.

## 🧹 What Gets Cleared

Before each demo bot starts working, the system performs a **complete browser cleanup**:

### Browser Data Cleared:
- ✅ **Cookies** - All authentication and session cookies
- ✅ **Local Storage** - Any cached user data or preferences
- ✅ **Session Storage** - Temporary session information
- ✅ **IndexedDB** - Any local database storage
- ✅ **Cache** - Browser cache and temporary files

### Result:
- **Completely fresh browser state**
- **No cached login sessions**
- **No pre-filled forms**
- **No stored user preferences**
- **Clean slate for every demo**

## 🔄 Enhanced Demo Flow

### Before (Old Behavior):
1. Bot navigates to terminal
2. Might be already logged in
3. Skips login process
4. Goes straight to workflow

### After (New Behavior):
1. **Clear ALL browser data** 🧹
2. Navigate to terminal
3. **Always see fresh login screen**
4. **Type email and password from scratch**
5. **Complete full login process**
6. **Navigate to dashboard/workflow**
7. **Perform complete user journey**

## 🎬 What You'll See in Videos

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Helper Function:
```typescript
export async function ensureBlankTerminal(page: Page) {
  // Clear all browser data
  await page.context().clearCookies();
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    localStorage.clear();
    sessionStorage.clear();
    // Clear IndexedDB
    if ('indexedDB' in window) {
      indexedDB.databases?.().then(databases => {
        databases.forEach(db => {
          if (db.name) {
            indexedDB.deleteDatabase(db.name);
          }
        });
      });
    }
  });
  await waitHuman(500);
}
```

### Enhanced Login Process:
```typescript
// Always start with fresh login
await ensureBlankTerminal(page);
await page.goto('/beta/broker');
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');

// Look for login form or login button
// Perform complete login from scratch
// Navigate to dashboard
// Perform user workflow
```
