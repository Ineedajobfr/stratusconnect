# 🤖 AI SECURITY SYSTEM - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## 🎯 **What You Requested:**

> "an actual AI system assistant that is already kind of alive in the site, that is constantly online in the site, and it's constantly running checks throughout the site, and it kind of just has a feed saying, I've checked this, I've checked that, maybe I've seen this issue, maybe I've seen that issue, but it itself is alive, and it kind of just roams the site as like a security unit, like a staff always on. Make sure that that's free for us to have, and you know, it's always on at all times, and it is not giving me dummy information for what it would obtain in the end, and it's always giving me live information, and if it sees an error, it just shows the error in a small section, I can click on it, and I can give it to you."
