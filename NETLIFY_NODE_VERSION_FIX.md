# Netlify Node Version Fix âœ…

## Issue
Netlify build was failing because Node version `20.18.1` specified in `.nvmrc` doesn't exist or isn't available on Netlify's build servers.

## Error Log
```
Line 10: Attempting Node.js version '20.18.1' from .nvmrc
Line 11: Downloading and installing node v20.18.1...
Line 12: Downloading https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.18.1/node-v20.18.1-linux-x64.tar.xz...
Line 13: Computing checksum with sha256sum
[Build failed]
```

## Solution Applied âœ…

Changed Node version from specific patch version to major version only:

### Before:
```
.nvmrc: 20.18.1
netlify.toml: NODE_VERSION = "20.18.1"
```

### After:
```
.nvmrc: 20
netlify.toml: NODE_VERSION = "20"
```

## Why This Works

Using just `"20"` tells Netlify to use the **latest stable Node 20.x version available** on their build servers, rather than requiring a specific patch version that may not exist.

This is the recommended approach by Netlify because:
- âœ… Always uses a supported version
- âœ… Automatically gets security updates
- âœ… No need to track specific patch versions
- âœ… More reliable builds

## Build Verification âœ…

Local build tested successfully:
- âœ… Build time: ~10.68 seconds  
- âœ… All 2309 modules compiled
- âœ… No errors or warnings

## Next Steps - Deploy Now! ðŸš€

1. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .nvmrc netlify.toml NETLIFY_BUILD_FIX.md NETLIFY_NODE_VERSION_FIX.md
   git commit -m "fix: update Node version to use latest 20.x for Netlify compatibility"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Clear Netlify cache and redeploy:**
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard â†’ Your Site
   - Navigate to **Deploys** section
   - Click **"Trigger deploy"** â†’ **"Clear cache and deploy site"**

3. **Monitor the deployment:**
   - Watch the build logs
   - Build should complete in 2-4 minutes
   - Look for: `Attempting Node.js version '20' from .nvmrc`
   - Should successfully download and use the latest Node 20.x

## Expected Result

Your Netlify deployment should now:
- âœ… Successfully download Node 20.x
- âœ… Install dependencies with `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps`
- âœ… Build your application successfully
- âœ… Deploy to production without errors

## Files Changed

- `.nvmrc` - Changed from `20.18.1` to `20`
- `netlify.toml` - Changed `NODE_VERSION` from `"20.18.1"` to `"20"`
- `NETLIFY_BUILD_FIX.md` - Updated documentation

**Status**: Ready for deployment! ðŸŽ‰
