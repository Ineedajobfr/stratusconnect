# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix Marketplace Database

## The Problem
Your marketplace is failing because the required database tables don't exist yet. The migration we ran earlier only added columns to existing tables, but the `marketplace_listings` table itself doesn't exist.

## The Solution
Run this new migration that creates all the missing tables:

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `pvgqfqkrtflpvajhddhr`
3. Go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)

### Step 2: Run the Complete Migration
1. Click **"New Query"**
2. Copy the **ENTIRE** content from `supabase/migrations/20251015000002_create_marketplace_tables.sql`
3. Paste it into the SQL Editor
4. Click **"Run"** button

### Step 3: Verify Success
You should see:
- âœ… "Success. No rows returned" (this is normal for DDL statements)
- No error messages

### Step 4: Refresh Your App
1. Go back to http://localhost:8080
2. Navigate to Broker Terminal â†’ Marketplace
3. The search should now work with sample aircraft data!

## What This Migration Creates:
- âœ… **marketplace_listings** table with sample data
- âœ… **aircraft_models** table with 20+ aircraft types
- âœ… **trip_requests** table for multi-leg trips
- âœ… **preferred_vendors** and **saved_searches** tables
- âœ… **Safety ratings** columns in profiles
- âœ… **Proper indexes** for fast searching
- âœ… **Row Level Security** policies
- âœ… **Sample data** so you can see results immediately

## After Running This:
- The marketplace will show sample aircraft listings
- Search and filters will work
- All errors will be resolved
- You'll have a fully functional marketplace!

**This is the missing piece - run it now!** ðŸš€
