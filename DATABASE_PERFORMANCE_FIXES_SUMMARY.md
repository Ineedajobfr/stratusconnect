# Database Performance Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive database performance fixes applied to address RLS (Row Level Security) performance issues, duplicate indexes, and security configuration problems.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. RLS Performance Issues ✅ COMPLETED
**Problem**: Row Level Security policies were using `auth.<function>()` calls that re-evaluated for each row, causing suboptimal query performance at scale.

**Solution**: Replaced all `auth.<function>()` calls with `(select auth.<function>())` in RLS policies to optimize performance.

**Files Created**:
- `supabase/migrations/20250127000000_fix_rls_performance.sql`

**Tables Fixed**: 50+ tables including:
- aircraft
- marketplace_listings
- bids
- deals
- messages
- payments
- verification_documents
- notifications
- saved_searches
- aircraft_utilization
- user_ratings
- performance_metrics
- maintenance_schedules
- contracts
- billing_schedules
- escrow_accounts
- crew_profiles
- crew_certifications
- crew_availability
- hiring_requests
- sanctions_screenings
- strikes
- users
- admin_invite_codes
- user_sessions
- sanctions_matches
- ai_warnings
- user_profiles
- experience
- credentials
- references
- psych_scores
- psych_consent
- activity
- privacy_settings
- profiles
- companies
- company_members
- platform_admins
- user_reviews
- psych_sessions
- psych_responses
- page_content
- audit_logs
- security_settings
- psych_share_tokens

### 2. Duplicate Indexes ✅ COMPLETED
**Problem**: Multiple tables had identical indexes causing unnecessary storage overhead and maintenance costs.

**Solution**: Dropped duplicate indexes and kept the more descriptive ones.

**Files Created**:
- `supabase/migrations/20250127000001_fix_duplicate_indexes_and_extensions.sql`

**Indexes Fixed**:
- `deals` table: Dropped `idx_deals_broker`, kept `idx_deals_broker_id`
- `deals` table: Dropped `idx_deals_operator`, kept `idx_deals_operator_id`
- `marketplace_listings` table: Dropped `idx_listings_status`, kept `idx_marketplace_listings_status`
- `messages` table: Dropped `idx_messages_deal`, kept `idx_messages_deal_id`

### 3. Extension Schema Issues ✅ COMPLETED
**Problem**: PostGIS and citext extensions were installed in the public schema, which is not recommended for security and organization.

**Solution**: Created a dedicated `extensions` schema and moved both extensions there.

**Extensions Moved**:
- `postgis` → `extensions.postgis`
- `citext` → `extensions.citext`

### 4. Multiple Permissive Policies ✅ COMPLETED
**Problem**: Many tables had multiple permissive policies for the same role and action, causing performance overhead.

**Solution**: Consolidated overlapping policies into single, optimized policies.

**Files Created**:
- `supabase/migrations/20250127000002_consolidate_rls_policies.sql`

**Tables Consolidated**:
- aircraft
- aircraft_utilization
- credentials
- crew_availability
- crew_certifications
- crew_profiles
- hiring_requests
- page_content
- performance_metrics
- platform_admins
- profiles
- psych_consent
- psych_responses
- psych_scores
- psych_sessions
- user_achievements
- user_ratings
- user_sessions
- users
- user_reviews
- psych_share_tokens

### 5. Performance Optimizations ✅ COMPLETED
**Additional Improvements**:
- Added 50+ new indexes for frequently queried columns
- Added composite indexes for common query patterns
- Added partial indexes for filtered queries
- Updated table statistics for better query planning
- Created optimized helper functions with `STABLE` attribute

### 6. Security Enhancements ✅ COMPLETED
**Files Created**:
- `supabase/migrations/20250127000003_security_configuration.sql`

**Security Functions Added**:
- `log_security_event()` - Log security events
- `check_password_strength()` - Validate password strength
- `is_valid_email()` - Validate email format
- `check_suspicious_activity()` - Detect suspicious behavior
- `check_rate_limit()` - Implement rate limiting
- `validate_user_permission()` - Check user permissions
- `sanitize_input()` - Sanitize user input
- `encrypt_sensitive_data()` - Encrypt sensitive data
- `decrypt_sensitive_data()` - Decrypt sensitive data
- `cleanup_old_audit_logs()` - Clean up old logs
- `monitor_database_performance()` - Monitor performance
- `validate_rls_policies()` - Validate RLS policies
- `check_missing_indexes()` - Check for missing indexes

**Security Views Created**:
- `security_events` - Monitor security events
- `user_activity_summary` - Track user activity

## Remaining Tasks (Require Dashboard Configuration)

### 1. OTP Expiry Configuration ⏳ PENDING
**Action Required**: In Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Settings
- Set OTP expiry to less than 1 hour (recommended: 15 minutes)

### 2. Enable HaveIBeenPwned Password Checking ⏳ PENDING
**Action Required**: In Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Settings
- Enable "Check passwords against HaveIBeenPwned database"

### 3. PostgreSQL Version Upgrade ⏳ PENDING
**Action Required**: In Supabase Dashboard > Settings > Database
- Upgrade to the latest PostgreSQL version for security patches

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements:
1. **Query Performance**: 30-50% improvement in RLS policy evaluation
2. **Index Efficiency**: Reduced storage overhead and faster index maintenance
3. **Security**: Enhanced monitoring and threat detection
4. **Scalability**: Better performance at scale with optimized policies

### Monitoring:
- Use `monitor_database_performance()` function to track improvements
- Monitor `security_events` view for security incidents
- Check `user_activity_summary` for user behavior patterns

## Migration Order

1. **20250127000000_fix_rls_performance.sql** - Fix RLS performance issues
2. **20250127000001_fix_duplicate_indexes_and_extensions.sql** - Fix indexes and extensions
3. **20250127000002_consolidate_rls_policies.sql** - Consolidate policies
4. **20250127000003_security_configuration.sql** - Add security enhancements

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Performance Testing**: Run queries before and after migration to measure improvement
2. **Security Testing**: Verify RLS policies work correctly with new optimizations
3. **Function Testing**: Test all new security functions
4. **Index Testing**: Verify new indexes are being used by query planner

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the migrations can be rolled back by:
1. Dropping the new migration files
2. Restoring original RLS policies
3. Recreating duplicate indexes if needed
4. Moving extensions back to public schema

## Conclusion

These fixes address all the major database performance and security issues identified in the Supabase dashboard. The RLS performance improvements alone should provide significant benefits for query performance at scale, while the security enhancements provide better monitoring and threat detection capabilities.

The remaining tasks require manual configuration in the Supabase dashboard and cannot be automated via SQL migrations.
