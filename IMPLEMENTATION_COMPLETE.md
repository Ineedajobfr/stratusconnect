              ↓
9. OPERATOR → Completes flight
              ↓
10. PLATFORM → Releases 93% payout to operator
              → Retains 7% commission

## 📈 Revenue Potential

### Commission Structure
- **Charter**: 7% of transaction value
- **Hiring**: 10% of placement fee
- **Aircraft Sale**: 3% of sale price

### Example Calculations

**Scenario 1: Charter Flight**
- Transaction: £100,000 charter booking
- Commission: £7,000 (7%)
- Operator Payout: £93,000
- Your Profit: £6,975 (after Stripe fees ~£25)

**Scenario 2: Pilot Hiring**
- Placement Fee: £10,000
- Commission: £1,000 (10%)
- Your Profit: £990

**Scenario 3: Aircraft Sale**
- Sale Price: £5,000,000 (G650ER)
- Commission: £150,000 (3%)
- Your Profit: £149,250

### Monthly Revenue Target (Conservative)

With just **10 active operators** averaging **2 charters/month each**:
- 20 charters × £75,000 avg × 7% = **£105,000/month**
- Minus Stripe fees (~£500) = **£104,500/month**
- Annual Revenue: **£1,254,000**
- Annual Costs: **£300** (12 × £25)
- **Net Profit: £1,253,700** (99.97% margin)
