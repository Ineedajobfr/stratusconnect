## **🎯 DETAILED ISSUE SUMMARIES:**

### **Test User Session Active:**
```
🔍 Root Cause: Admin console test user impersonation feature is being used for testing purposes
⚠️ Impact: Normal operation - this is expected during testing but should be monitored for security
✅ Solution: Complete testing session and clear test user data when done
🛡️ Prevention: Always clear test sessions after testing, monitor for unauthorized impersonation
```

### **Database Performance Issues:**
```
🔍 Root Cause: High load, network latency, or inefficient queries
⚠️ Impact: Users may experience slower page loads and degraded performance
✅ Solution: Check database load, optimize queries, consider scaling resources
🛡️ Prevention: Monitor database performance regularly, implement query optimization
```

### **High Memory Usage:**
```
🔍 Root Cause: Memory leaks, large data sets, or inefficient memory management
⚠️ Impact: Browser performance degradation, potential crashes on low-memory devices
✅ Solution: Identify and fix memory leaks, optimize data handling, clear unused objects
🛡️ Prevention: Implement proper cleanup, monitor memory usage, use efficient data structures
```

### **System Errors:**
```
🔍 Root Cause: Code bugs, missing dependencies, or API failures
⚠️ Impact: Features may not work correctly, poor user experience
✅ Solution: Review console errors, fix code issues, update dependencies
🛡️ Prevention: Implement proper error handling, test thoroughly, use TypeScript
```

### **API Connection Issues:**
```
🔍 Root Cause: Network issues, API downtime, or configuration problems
⚠️ Impact: Features depending on external services will not work
✅ Solution: Check network connectivity, verify API status, review configuration
🛡️ Prevention: Implement API health checks, use fallback mechanisms, monitor uptime
```
