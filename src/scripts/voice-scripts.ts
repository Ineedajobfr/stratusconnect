The AI Search Assistant is not your typical search function. It understands complex aviation terminology, aircraft specifications, and operational requirements. You can describe what you need in plain English, and it will analyze your request against our database of aircraft, routes, and services.

It's like having a conversation with someone who knows everything about aviation. You can say "I need a jet that can handle 12 passengers for a transatlantic flight," and it will find exactly what you're looking for. No more scrolling through irrelevant results or trying to figure out the right search terms.

Predictive Analytics analyzes historical data, market trends, and operational patterns to give you insights that would take humans weeks to figure out. This includes fleet optimization recommendations, demand forecasting models, and performance analytics that help you maximize efficiency and profitability.

  // Search Tips Script (6 minutes)
  searchTips: `Welcome to the search functionality tutorial. Let me teach you how to master the search features on StratusConnect.

The AI Search Assistant represents the cutting edge of aviation technology. This is not your typical search box that just looks for keywords. It can process natural language queries and understand complex aviation terminology, aircraft specifications, and operational requirements.

You don't need to learn any special aviation search language. Just describe what you're looking for in plain English, and the system will figure it out. You can say things like "I need a jet for a business trip to Europe" or "Find me aircraft that can handle short runways," and it will understand exactly what you mean.

The key is to be specific but not overly technical. Instead of searching for "Gulfstream G650," try "I need a long-range business jet that can fly 7,000 miles non-stop." The system will find the right aircraft and show you all the relevant options.

You can combine multiple criteria to get precise results. Want an aircraft that can handle 8 passengers, fly 3,000 miles, and land on short runways? Just tell the system that. It will search through the entire database and find exactly what you need.

The filters are helpful, but don't overuse them. Start broad, then narrow down. The system can filter by aircraft type, departure and arrival locations, date ranges, price brackets, and availability. The magic happens when you combine these filters with natural language descriptions.

Here's a pro tip: save your searches. If you find a search that works well for your needs, save it. The system will remember it, and you can run it again with one click. It's like having a personal assistant who remembers all your preferences.

The search results are not just a list of aircraft—they are intelligent recommendations based on your specific needs. The system analyzes your requirements against the database and ranks results by relevance, not just by price or availability.

Test out different search queries, experiment with filters, and see how powerful the search functionality really is.

Once you master these search techniques, you'll find exactly what you need every time.`,

  // Payment & Escrow Script (4 minutes)
  paymentEscrow: `Welcome to the payment and escrow system tutorial. Let me walk you through how money works on StratusConnect.

Let's talk about security first, because that's what matters most when it comes to money. StratusConnect implements enterprise-grade security protocols for all financial transactions. We use bank-level encryption, secure payment processing, and systems that are constantly monitored for any suspicious activity.

Your money is safer here than it would be in a traditional bank. We use the same security standards that major financial institutions use, but with additional layers of protection specifically designed for aviation transactions.

We support all the major payment options: credit cards, bank transfers, digital wallets, and more. The system automatically processes payments using the most secure method available, and all transactions are encrypted from start to finish.

The escrow system is what makes StratusConnect different from other platforms. When you make a payment, the money doesn't go directly to the seller. Instead, it goes into a secure escrow account where it's held until the service is completed and verified.

Think of it like having a trusted third party hold your money until everyone is happy. The buyer gets their service, the seller gets their payment, and everyone is protected throughout the entire process. No more worrying about getting scammed or dealing with payment disputes.

The verification process is thorough but not complicated. Once a service is completed, both parties confirm that everything went as expected. Only then is the payment released. It's like having a personal financial advisor who makes sure every transaction is legitimate.

Make a test transaction, explore the payment options, and see how secure and reliable the financial system really is.

Once you experience how smooth and secure the payments are, you'll never want to go back to traditional methods.`,
