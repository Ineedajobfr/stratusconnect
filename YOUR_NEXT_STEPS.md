## 🚨 Important Notes

### TensorFlow.js Model
- **Current**: Basic file validation (works perfectly)
- **Future**: Train custom model on aviation images
- **Alternative**: Use Google Vision API (but costs £)
- **Recommendation**: Launch with current system, enhance later

### Stripe Integration
- **Test Mode**: Use test keys for development
- **Production**: Switch to live keys when ready
- **Connect Onboarding**: Operators need to complete Stripe verification
- **Timeline**: Can launch with test mode, add real payments within days

### Real-Time Features
- **Current**: Manual refresh for updates
- **Future**: Add Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- **Impact**: Not critical for launch
- **Timeline**: Can add post-launch

## 📞 If You Need Help

### Common Issues

**"Migration failed" or "relation already exists"**
- This is normal if tables exist - migrations use `IF NOT EXISTS`
- Safe to ignore these warnings

**"TensorFlow.js import error"**
- Dev server has been restarted
- Should be working now
- If not, run: `npm install @tensorflow/tfjs`

**"Storage bucket creation failed"**
- Check Supabase storage permissions
- Try creating manually in dashboard
- Ensure bucket name is exactly `aircraft-images`

**"Stripe integration not working"**
- Check environment variables in `.env`
- Ensure `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set
- For now, use Stripe test keys
