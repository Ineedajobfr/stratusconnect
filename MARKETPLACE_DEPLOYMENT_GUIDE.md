# 🚀 Marketplace Deployment Guide

## ✅ Fixed Migration Issues

### Issue 1: `trip_requests` table not existing
**Problem**: Migration tried to `ALTER TABLE trip_requests` before creating it.

**Solution**: The migration now:
1. Creates `trip_requests` table first (if it doesn't exist)
2. Then adds new columns (trip_type, legs, return_date, etc.)

### Issue 2: `active` column not existing  
**Problem**: Database uses `status` TEXT column, but code referenced `active` BOOLEAN.

**Solution**: The migration now:
1. Creates `marketplace_listings` with both `status` and `active` columns
2. Adds `active` column if it doesn't exist (backward compatible)
3. Syncs `active` with `status` (`active = true` when `status = 'active'`)
4. Adds a trigger to keep them in sync automatically
5. All RLS policies and indexes use `active` for consistency

## 📋 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

**IMPORTANT**: Use the **SAFE migration** that's compatible with your existing schema!

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of:
   ```
   supabase/migrations/20251015000001_marketplace_enhancements_safe.sql
   ```
4. Click **RUN**

**Why the safe version?**
- Your existing database uses `departure_location`, `asking_price`, `status` columns
- The safe migration only adds new columns without recreating tables
- Includes schema adapter for automatic translation

**What this creates**:
- ✅ 8 new tables (aircraft_models, trip_requests, marketplace_listings, quotes, user_reputation, security_events, preferred_vendors, saved_searches, airports, marketplace_activity)
- ✅ 24 aircraft models (G650, Citation X, etc.)
- ✅ 25 major airports (JFK, LHR, CDG, etc.)
- ✅ All necessary indexes
- ✅ All RLS policies
- ✅ Permission grants

### Step 2: Regenerate Supabase Types

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Supabase project ID (found in project settings).

**Alternative method** (if you have Supabase CLI linked):
```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --linked > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works

The TypeScript errors you saw earlier will **automatically disappear** after Step 2.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### TypeScript Errors Still Showing?
**Solution**: Make sure you've completed Step 2 (regenerate types).

### Can't see new tables in Supabase?
**Solution**: Refresh your Supabase dashboard. Go to Table Editor to verify all tables exist.

### RLS Policy Errors?
**Solution**: The migration includes all necessary RLS policies. If you get permission errors, double-check the migration ran successfully.

### Empty aircraft models dropdown?
**Solution**: The migration includes 24 pre-loaded aircraft models. If empty, re-run the migration's INSERT section.

### Airport lookup not working?
**Solution**: 25 popular airports are pre-loaded. If not showing, re-run the airports INSERT section.
