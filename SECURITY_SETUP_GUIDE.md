## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Database Setup

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to create the security tables:

```bash
# The migration file is ready at:
supabase/migrations/20250101000003_security_tables.sql
```

Or if using Supabase CLI:

```bash
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Deploy Edge Functions (Optional)

If you want server-side protection:

```bash
# Deploy rate limiter
supabase functions deploy rate-limiter

# Deploy input validator
supabase functions deploy validate-input

# Deploy code scanner
supabase functions deploy scan-user-code
```

### Step 3: Access the Security Dashboard

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/security-dashboard`
3. Monitor your security in real-time!

## 🔐 Security Features Active

### ✅ Currently Protecting You:

1. **Secret Detection**: Prevents API keys from being committed
2. **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy blocks malicious scripts
3. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and cleaned
4. **Bot Detection**: Advanced fingerprinting identifies automated threats
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents DDoS and scraping attacks
6. **SQL Injection Protection**: Input validation blocks injection attempts
7. **Malicious Code Detection**: Scans uploaded code for threats
8. **Real-time Monitoring**: Live security event tracking

### 📊 Monitoring Coverage:

- ✓ SQL Injection attempts
- ✓ XSS attacks
- ✓ Command injection
- ✓ Path traversal
- ✓ Bot/scraper detection
- ✓ Rate limit violations
- ✓ Suspicious activity
- ✓ Dependency vulnerabilities

## 🎯 What Happens Automatically

### On Every Commit:
- Gitleaks scans for secrets
- ESLint security checks run
- npm audit checks dependencies
- Type checking verifies code safety

### On Every Push/PR:
- Full security scan in GitHub Actions
- Dependency vulnerability check
- Code analysis with Semgrep
- Security report generated

### In Production:
- Real-time input validation
- Bot detection on every request
- Rate limiting per IP/user
- Security event logging

## 📱 Using the Security System

### Frontend Usage:

```typescript
// Sanitize user input
import { sanitizeInput } from '@/lib/security/input-sanitizer'

const result = sanitizeInput(userInput, 'description', 'text')
if (!result.isValid) {
  console.error('Security threat detected:', result.threats)
}

// Detect bots
import { antiScraper } from '@/lib/security/anti-scraper'

const detection = antiScraper.detectBot()
if (detection.isBot) {
  // Handle bot traffic
}

// Create security alert
import { securityAlerts } from '@/lib/security/alerts'

await securityAlerts.createAlert({
  type: 'suspicious_activity',
  severity: 'high',
  title: 'Unusual Activity Detected',
  description: 'Multiple failed login attempts',
  source: 'auth_system',
  metadata: { attempts: 5 }
})
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Security Levels:

**Development Mode** (Current):
- Console logging enabled
- Detailed error messages
- All features active

**Production Mode**:
- Silent error handling
- Minimal exposure
- Enhanced monitoring

### Adjusting Thresholds:

Edit these files to customize:
- `security-patterns.json` - Threat detection patterns
- `.gitleaks.toml` - Secret scanning rules
- `.eslintrc.security.json` - Code security rules

## 📈 Next Steps

### Recommended Actions:

1. **✓ Test the Dashboard**: Visit `/security-dashboard` to see it in action
2. **Configure Notifications**: Set up Slack/Discord webhooks for alerts
3. **Review Security Patterns**: Customize threat detection in `security-patterns.json`
4. **Set Up CI/CD**: GitHub Actions will run automatically on your next commit
5. **Deploy Edge Functions**: Optional server-side protection (see Step 2 above)

### Optional Enhancements:

- Add CAPTCHA for high-risk operations
- Configure email notifications for critical alerts
- Set up custom security rules for your use case
- Integrate with external security services

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Dashboard not loading?**
- Ensure you're logged in as an admin
- Check the route is `/security-dashboard`
- Verify the migration ran successfully

**Pre-commit hooks not running?**
- Run: `npm run prepare` to set up Husky
- Make sure Gitleaks is installed (optional)

**Type errors in new files?**
- Run: `npm install` to ensure all packages are installed
- The security files use TypeScript and should auto-complete
